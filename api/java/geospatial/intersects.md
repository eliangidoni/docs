# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.intersects(geometry) &rarr; sequence
geometry.intersects(geometry) &rarr; bool
r.intersects(sequence, geometry) &rarr; sequence
r.intersects(geometry, geometry) &rarr; bool
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Tests whether two geometry objects intersect with one another. When applied to a sequence of geometry objects, `intersects` acts as a [filter](/api/java/filter), returning a sequence of objects from the sequence that intersect with the argument.

__Example:__ Is `point2` within a 2000-meter circle around `point1`?

```java
import com.rethinkdb.gen.ast.Point;

Point point1 = r.point(-117.220406,32.719464);
Point point2 = r.point(-117.206201,32.725186);

r.circle(point1, 2000).intersects(point2).run(conn);

// Result:
true
```

__Example:__ Which of the locations in a list of parks intersect a given circle?

```java
r.table("parks").g("area")
 .intersects(r.circle(r.array(-117.220406, 32.719464), 10).optArg("unit", "mi"))
 .run(conn);
```
