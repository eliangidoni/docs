# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.innerJoin(otherSequence, predicate_function) &rarr; stream
array.innerJoin(otherSequence, predicate_function) &rarr; array
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Returns an inner join of two sequences. The returned sequence represents an intersection of the left-hand sequence and the right-hand sequence: each row of the left-hand sequence will be compared with each row of the right-hand sequence to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate. Each matched pair of rows of both sequences are combined into a result row. In most cases, you will want to follow the join with [zip](/api/java/zip) to combine the left and right results.

{% infobox %}
Note that `innerJoin` is slower and much less efficient than using [eqJoin](/api/java/eq_join/) or [concatMap](/api/java/concat_map/) with [getAll](/api/java/get_all/). You should avoid using `innerJoin` in commands when possible.

__Example:__ Return a list of all matchups between Marvel and DC heroes in which the DC hero could beat the Marvel hero in a fight.

```java
r.table("marvel").innerJoin(r.table("dc"),
    (marvel_row, dc_row) -> marvel_row.g("strength").lt(dc_row.g("strength"))
).zip().run(conn);
```

(Compare this to an [outerJoin](/api/java/outer_join) with the same inputs and predicate, which would return a list of *all* Marvel heroes along with any DC heroes with a higher strength.)
