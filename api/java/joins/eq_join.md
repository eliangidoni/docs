Join tables using a field or function on the left-hand sequence matching primary keys or secondary indexes on the right-hand table. `eqJoin` is more efficient than other ReQL join types, and operates much faster. Documents in the result set consist of pairs of left-hand and right-hand documents, matched when the field on the left-hand side exists and is non-null and an entry with that field's value exists in the specified index on the right-hand side.

The result set of `eqJoin` is a stream or array of objects. Each object in the returned set will be an object of the form `{ "left": <left-document>, "right": <right-document> }`, where the values of `left` and `right` will be the joined documents. Use the [zip](/api/java/zip/) command to merge the `left` and `right` fields together.

**Example:** Match players with the games they've played against one another.

The players table contains these documents (shown in JSON form):

```json
[
    { "id": 1, "player": "George", "gameId": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "player": "Agatha", "gameId": 3 },
    { "id": 3, "player": "Fred", "gameId": 2 },
    { "id": 4, "player": "Marie", "gameId": 2 },
    { "id": 5, "player": "Earnest", "gameId": 1 },
    { "id": 6, "player": "Beth", "gameId": 3 }
]
```

The games table contains these documents:

```json
[
    { "id": 1, "field": "Little Delving" },
    { "id": 2, "field": "Rushock Bog" },
    { "id": 3, "field": "Bucklebury" }
]
```

Join these tables using `gameId` on the player table and `id` on the games table:

```java
r.table("players").eqJoin("gameId", r.table("games")).run(conn);
```

This will return a result set such as the following:

```json
[
    {
        "left" : { "gameId" : 3, "id" : 2, "player" : "Agatha" },
        "right" : { "id" : 3, "field" : "Bucklebury" }
    },
    {
        "left" : { "gameId" : 2, "id" : 3, "player" : "Fred" },
        "right" : { "id" : 2, "field" : "Rushock Bog" }
    },
    ...
]
```

What you likely want is the result of using `zip` with that. For clarity, we'll use `without` to drop the `id` field from the games table (it conflicts with the `id` field for the players and it's redundant anyway), and we'll order it by the games.

```java
r.table("players")
 .eqJoin("game_id", r.table("games"))
 .without(r.hashMap("right", "id"))
 .zip()
 .orderBy("game_id")
 .run(conn);
```

```json
[
    { "field": "Little Delving", "gameId": 1, "id": 5, "player": "Earnest" },
    { "field": "Little Delving", "gameId": 1, "id": 1, "player": "George" },
    { "field": "Rushock Bog", "gameId": 2, "id": 3, "player": "Fred" },
    { "field": "Rushock Bog", "gameId": 2, "id": 4, "player": "Marie" },
    { "field": "Bucklebury", "gameId": 3, "id": 6, "player": "Beth" },
    { "field": "Bucklebury", "gameId": 3, "id": 2, "player": "Agatha" }
]
```

For more information, see [Table joins in RethinkDB](/docs/table-joins/).

**Example:** Use a secondary index on the right table rather than the primary key. If players have a secondary index on their cities, we can get a list of arenas with players in the same area.

```java
r.table("arenas").eqJoin("city_id", r.table("arenas"))
 .optArg("index", "city_id").run(conn);
```

**Example:** Use a nested key as the join field. Suppose the documents in the players table were structured like this:

```json
{ "id": 1, "player": "George", "game": {"id": 1} },
{ "id": 2, "player": "Agatha", "game": {"id": 3} },
...
```

Simply specify the field using a lambda instead of a string.

```java
r.table("players").eqJoin(
    row -> row.g("game").g("id"),
    r.table("games")
).without(r.hashMap("right", "id")).zip().run(conn);
```

```json
[
    { "field": "Little Delving", "game": { "id": 1 }, "id": 5, "player": "Earnest" },
    { "field": "Little Delving", "game": { "id": 1 }, "id": 1, "player": "George" },
    ...
]
```

**Example:** Use a function instead of a field to join on a more complicated expression. Suppose the players have lists of favorite games ranked in order in a field such as `favorites: [3, 2, 1]`. Get a list of players and their top favorite:

```java
r.table("players3").eqJoin(
    player -> player.g("favorites").nth(0),
    r.table("games")
).without(
    r.array(r.hashMap("left", r.array("favorites", "game_id", "id")),
    r.hashMap("right", "id"))
).zip().run(conn);
```

```json
[
	{ "field": "Rushock Bog", "name": "Fred" },
	{ "field": "Little Delving", "name": "George" },
	...
]
```
