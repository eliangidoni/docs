# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.hasFields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; stream
array.hasFields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; array
object.hasFields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; boolean
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Test if an object has one or more fields. An object has a field if it has that key and the key has a non-null value. For instance, the object `{'a': 1,'b': 2,'c': null}` has the fields `a` and `b`.

When applied to a single object, `hasFields` returns `true` if the object has the fields and `false` if it does not. When applied to a sequence, it will return a new sequence (an array or stream) containing the elements that have the specified fields.

__Example:__ Return the players who have won games.

```java
r.table("players").hasFields("games_won").run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Return the players who have *not* won games. To do this, use `hasFields` with [not](/api/java/not), wrapped with [filter](/api/java/filter).

```java
r.table("players").filter(
    row -> row.hasFields("games_won").not()
).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Test if a specific player has won any games.

```java
r.table("players").get("b5ec9714-837e-400c-aa74-dbd35c9a7c4c")
 .hasFields("games_won").run(conn);
```

**Nested Fields**

`hasFields` lets you test for nested fields in objects. If the value of a field is itself a set of key/value pairs, you can test for the presence of specific keys.

__Example:__ In the `players` table, the `games_won` field contains one or more fields for kinds of games won:

```json
{
    "games_won": {
        "playoffs": 2,
        "championships": 1
    }
}
```

Return players who have the "championships" field.

```java
r.table("players")
 .hasFields(r.hashMap("games_won", r.hashMap("championships", true)))
 .run(conn);
```

Note that `true` in the example above is testing for the existence of `championships` as a field, not testing to see if the value of the `championships` field is set to `true`. There's a more convenient shorthand form available. (See [pluck](/api/java/pluck) for more details on this.)

```java
r.table("players").hasFields(r.hashMap("games_won", "championships")).run(conn);
```
